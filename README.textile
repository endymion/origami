h1. Chaise

A Rails Engine plugin that handles the tedious parts of setting up HTML/CSS layouts.

h2. Engine

Chaise is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.  It will not work with previous version of Rails because they will not import the layout templates from app/views/layouts in Chaise.  It may be possible to make Chaise work with the Rails Engine plugin, but currently it only works with Rails 2.3.

h2. Install

Do this for now:

	script/plugin install http://github.com/endymion/chaise/tree/master

This is how I'm trying to get it to work but I'm currently having problems making Chaise available as a Ruby Gem:

In config/environment.rb:

    config.gem "endymion-chaise",
      :lib     => 'chaise',
      :source  => 'http://gems.github.com',
      :version => '>=0.1.0'

Vendor the gem:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack
