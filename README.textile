h1. Chaise

A Rails Engine plugin that handles the tedious parts of setting up HTML/CSS layouts.  Developing Rails apps is a very high-level pursuit, but at some point you have to code an HTML layout and styling for your web applications.  That can be pretty tedious unless you have A Way.  There is no One True Way to lay out a web page, any more than there is One True Way to watch a sunset.  But Chaise is a nice way.

h2. The Problem

Properly coding an HTML layout is a pain in the neck.  You have to put down your beautiful high-level Ruby code to deal with ugliness like:

	<pre>
	<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
	<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
	</pre>

Code like this is important, but it's clutter that disrupts your thought processes.  Apply Feng Shui to your application and get the clutter out of sight.

h2. The Solution

In your config/environment.rb:

	layouts = {
		:format => 2_column_left_menu_pixel,
		:width => 980,
		:sidebar_A_width => 150
	}
	
In your views:

	<% content_for :sidebar_A do %>
	Put something here.
	<% end %>

Chaise does the rest.  It wraps your page body in the necessary divs, calculates the necessary styles, and applies them using app/views/layouts/application.rb.  You get validating HTML code that works in any browser and you don't have to think about HTML or CSS.  You focus on your application instead.

h2. Customize

You can override any of the templates in the app/views/layouts folder in Chaise.  For example, if you're particular about your HTML DTD or something then copy the app/views/layouts/_head.html.erb file to your application and change it.  Rails 2.3 will use your template instead of the one from Chaise.

If you're in a hurry then you might rather just customize the page title and a few other things using environment.rb constants:

	TITLE = 'Your Web Site Title Here'
	DESCRIPTION = 'Your meta description tag.' # Optional.
	KEYWORDS = 'Your, Keywords, Here' # Optional.
	ICON = 'http://you/your/shortcut/icon.gif'
	THEME = 'blue' # Style sheet theme name. # Optional.
	WIDTH = '980px' # The overall page width, as a CSS value.  ie: '980px', '100%', '100em'

h2. Optional

Google Analytics snippets are a common enough layout element that you can generate one automatically by just setting your Google Analytics account code in your environment.rb:

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT = 'UA-376????-?'

h2. Engine

Chaise is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than 2.3.  It will not work with previous version of Rails because they will not import the layout templates from app/views/layouts in Chaise.  It may be possible to make Chaise work with the Rails Engine plugin, but currently it only works with Rails 2.3.

h2. Install

Do this for now:

	script/plugin install http://github.com/endymion/chaise/tree/master

This is how I'm trying to get it to work but I'm currently having problems making Chaise available as a Ruby Gem:

In config/environment.rb:

    config.gem "endymion-chaise",
      :lib     => 'chaise',
      :source  => 'http://gems.github.com',
      :version => '>=0.1.0'

Vendor the gem:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack
