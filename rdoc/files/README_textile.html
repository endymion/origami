h1. Origami
</p>
<p>
A Rails Engine plugin that handles the tedious parts of setting up HTML/CSS
layouts. Developing Rails apps is a very high-level pursuit, but at some
point you have to code an HTML layout and styling for your web
applications. That can be pretty tedious unless you have A Way. There is no
One True Way to lay out a web page, any more than there is One True Way to
watch a sunset. But Origami is a nice way.
</p>
<p>
h2. The Problem
</p>
<p>
Properly coding an HTML layout is a pain in the neck. You have to put down
your beautiful high-level Ruby code to deal with ugliness like:
</p>
<pre>
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
        &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
        &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Code like this is important, but it&#8216;s clutter that disrupts your
thought processes. Apply Feng Shui to your application and get the clutter
out of sight.
</p>
<p>
h2. The Solution
</p>
<p>
In your controller:
</p>
<pre>
    layout '2_column_left_menu_pixel'
</pre>
<p>
In your views:
</p>
<pre>
        Blah blah blah the body of your view automatically goes in &quot;column_1&quot;, which
        will always be at the top of the HTML file and other columns will always
        come after it.
    &lt;% content_for :column_2 do %&gt;
    Put something here.
    &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Origami does the rest. It wraps your page body in the necessary divs,
calculates the necessary styles, and applies them using
app/views/layouts/application.rb. You get validating HTML code that works
in any browser and you don&#8216;t have to think about HTML or CSS. You
focus on your application instead.
</p>
<p>
h2. Features
</p>
<p>
h3. Blueprint
</p>
<p>
Sensible CSS defaults from &quot;BlueTrip&quot;:<a
href="http://bluetrip.org">bluetrip.org</a>
</p>
<p>
h3. Matthew James Taylor templates
</p>
<p>
Origami uses HTML/CSS layouts by &quot;Matthew James Taylor&quot;:<a
href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com">matthewjamestaylor.com</a>/ which have
many features:
</p>
<p>
h3. No CSS Hacks
</p>
<p>
The CSS used for the layouts in Origami are 100% valid and hack free. To
overcome Internet Explorer&#8216;s broken box model, no horizontal padding
or margins are used. Instead, this design uses percentage widths and clever
relative positioning.
</p>
<p>
h3. SEO friendly 2-1 column ordering
</p>
<p>
The higher up content is in your page code, the more important it is
considered by search engine algorithms. To make your website as optimised
as possible your main page content must come before the side columns. This
layout does exactly that: The the right-hand main page comes first, then
the left column (see the nested div structure diagram for more info). The
columns can also be configured in the opposite order if required.
</p>
<p>
h3. Full length column background colours
</p>
<p>
In this layout the background colours of each column will always stretch to
the length of the longest column. This feature was traditionally only
available with table based layouts but now with a little CSS trickery we
can do exactly the same with divs. Say goodbye to annoying short columns!
</p>
<p>
h3. No Images
</p>
<p>
This layout requires no images. Many CSS website designs need images to
colour in the column backgrounds but that is not necessary with this
design. Why waste bandwidth and precious HTTP requests when you can do
everything in pure CSS and XHTML?
</p>
<p>
h3. No JavaScript
</p>
<p>
JavaScript is not required. Some website layouts rely on JavaScript hacks
to resize divs and force elements into place but you won&#8216;t see any of
that nonsense here.
</p>
<p>
h3. Resizable text compatible
</p>
<p>
This layout is fully compatible with resizable text. Resizable text is
important for web accessibility. People who are vision impaired can make
the text larger so it&#8216;s easier for them to read. It is becoming
increasingly more important to make your website resizable text compatible
because people are expecting higher levels of web accessibility. Apple have
made resizing the text on a website simple with the pinch gesture on their
multi-touch trackpad. So far this trackpad is only available on the MacBook
Air but it will soon be rolled out to all of their systems. Is your website
text-resizing compatible?
</p>
<p>
h3. No Quirks Mode
</p>
<p>
This liquid layout does not require the XML declaration for it to display
correctly in older versions of Internet Explorer. This version works
without it and is thus never in quirks mode.
</p>
<p>
h3. No IE Conditional Comments
</p>
<p>
Only one stylesheet is used with this layout This means that IE conditional
comments are not needed to set extra CSS rules for older versions of
Internet Explorer. This also means that ActivePackager can compress and
consolidate the styles without breaking them.
</p>
<p>
h3. Browser Compatibility
</p>
<p>
This left menu liquid Layout has been tested on the following browsers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone &amp; iPod Touch

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** Safari
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** Safari ** Firefox ** Opera 9.25 ** Netscape 9.0.0.5 &amp; 7.1
</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows

</li>
</ul>
<p>
** Firefox 1.5, 2 &amp; 3 ** Safari ** Opera 8.1 &amp; 9 ** Google Chrome
** Explorer 5.5, 6 &amp; 7 ** Netscape 8
</p>
<p>
h3. Valid XHTML strict markup
</p>
<p>
The HTML in this layout validates as XHTML 1.0 strict.
</p>
<p>
h2. Customize
</p>
<p>
You can override any of the templates in the app/views/layouts folder in
Origami. For example, if you&#8216;re particular about your HTML DTD or
something then copy the app/views/layouts/_head.html.erb file to your
application and change it. Rails 2.3 will use your template instead of the
one from Origami.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8216;re in a hurry then you might rather just customize the page
title and a few other things using environment.rb constants:
</p>
<pre>
        TITLE = 'Your Web Site Title Here'
        DESCRIPTION = 'Your meta description tag.' # Optional.
        KEYWORDS = 'Your, Keywords, Here' # Optional.
        ICON = 'http://you/your/shortcut/icon.gif'
        THEME = 'blue' # Style sheet theme name. # Optional.
        WIDTH = '980px' # The overall page width, as a CSS value.  ie: '980px', '100%', '100em'
</pre>
<p>
h2. Optional
</p>
<p>
Google Analytics snippets are a common enough layout element that you can
generate one automatically by just setting your Google Analytics account
code in your environment.rb:
</p>
<pre>
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT = 'UA-376????-?'
</pre>
<p>
h2. Engine
</p>
<p>
Origami is a Rails engine. It works with versions of Rails greater than
2.3. It will not work with previous version of Rails because they will not
import the layout templates from app/views/layouts in Origami. It may be
possible to make Origami work with the Rails Engine plugin, but currently
it only works with Rails 2.3.
</p>
<p>
h2. Install
</p>
<p>
Do this for now:
</p>
<pre>
        script/plugin install http://github.com/endymion/origami/tree/master
</pre>
<p>
This is how I&#8216;m trying to get it to work but I&#8216;m currently
having problems making Origami available as a Ruby Gem:
</p>
<p>
In config/environment.rb:
</p>
<pre>
    config.gem &quot;endymion-origami&quot;,
      :lib     =&gt; 'origami',
      :source  =&gt; 'http://gems.github.com',
      :version =&gt; '&gt;=0.1.0'
</pre>
<p>
Vendor the gem:
</p>
<pre>
    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack
</pre>
